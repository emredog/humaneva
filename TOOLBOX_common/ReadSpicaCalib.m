function [fc, cc, alpha_c, kc, Rc_ext, omc_ext, Tc_ext] = ReadSpicaCalib(calfilename);
% Reads the calibration from the file
%
% Format:
%   [FC, CC, ALPHA_C, KC, RC_EXT, OMC_EXT, TC_EXT] 
%                                = ReadSpicaCalib(CALFILENAME);
%
% Input:
%    CALFILENAME - file name of the calibration (e.g. Spica1Calib.cal) 
%                  including full path
%
% Output: 
%    FC      - Focal length (2x1)
%    CC      - Principle point (2x1)
%    ALPHA_C - Skew coefficient (1x1)
%    KC      - Distortion coefficient (5x1)
%    RC_EXT  - Extrinsic rotation matrix (3x3)
%    OMC_EXT - Extrinsic rotation angles, simply a decomposition
%              of RC_EXT (3x1)
%    TC_EXT  - Extrinsic translation vector (3x1)
%
% To map from world coordinate point X to the camera reference frame 
% point Xc, do the following: Xc = RC_EXT * X + TC_EXT;
